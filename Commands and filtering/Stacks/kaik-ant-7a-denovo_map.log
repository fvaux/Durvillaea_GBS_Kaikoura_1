Attempted to assemble and align paired-end reads for 248181 loci:
  0 loci had no or almost no paired-end reads (0.0%);
  1637 loci had paired-end reads that couldn't be assembled into a contig (0.7%);
  For the remaining 246544 loci (99.3%), a paired-end contig was assembled;
    Average contig size was 135.0 bp;
  59304 paired-end contigs overlapped the forward region (24.1%)
    Mean overlap: 25.3bp; mean size of overlapped loci after merging: 101.1;
  Out of 319345476 paired-end reads in these loci (mean 1275.2 reads per locus),
    314398419 were successfuly aligned (98.5%);
  Mean insert length was 101.2, stdev: 22.4 (based on aligned reads in overlapped loci).

Genotyped 246526 loci:
  effective per-sample coverage: mean=53.3x, stdev=28.2x, min=15.3x, max=164.6x
  mean number of sites per locus: 127.4
  a consistent phasing was found for 164319 of out 304233 (54.0%) diploid loci needing phasing
